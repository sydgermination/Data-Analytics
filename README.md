# 📊 Mobile Usage Data Analytics

This project explores and analyzes a dataset containing mobile user behavioral patterns. It uses Python libraries such as **Pandas**, **Seaborn**, **Matplotlib**, and **Scikit-learn** to perform data visualization, statistical analysis, and machine learning-based classification.

## 📁 Dataset
- **Source**: `mobile_usage_behavioral_analysis.csv` https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amirhosseinrmz09/mobile-usage-behavioral-analysis/data
- Includes features like app usage, device behavior, session patterns, and user demographics.

## 📊 Key Analyses
- 📌 **Gender Distribution**: Visualized using a pie chart to understand the demographic breakdown.
- 🔥 **Correlation Matrix**: Heatmap of numerical feature relationships.
- 📈 **Behavior Classification**: Predictive modeling using Logistic Regression.

## ⚙️ Machine Learning Workflow
- Label encoding for categorical variables.
- Standardization using `StandardScaler`.
- Train-test split with stratification.
- Accuracy evaluation and classification report output.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- `pandas`, `numpy`
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

## 📌 Results
- Achieved behavior classification using Logistic Regression.
- Ready for future improvement with additional ML models (e.g., Random Forest, SVM).

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Install required libraries with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Replace the CSV path in the code with your local dataset location.
3. Run the notebook or script in your preferred Python environment.
